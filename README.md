# french-top-jobs

!!! warning
    WIP : This project is currently under active development and is not at all finished

## Context

The idea is to have a personal job board, focused on the french market, on which you would have several functionalities :

* Display the top 500 french companies (start up/scale up) jobs offers
* Select the companies (not only in the 500 top french companies list) you want to look at for jobs in order to make a kind of wishlist and get alerted if a new job is out
* Try to avoid the noise by eliminating the contractors companies that most of the time flood the different well known job boards (indeed, jobteaser, welcome to the jungle, etc...)
* Be able to filter by title of the job (devops/sre, frontend developper, backend developper, etc...)
